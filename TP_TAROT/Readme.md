# README
Sometimes, and i don't know why, all the images used in the application are removed from the project when you build it in your IDE. To prevent you from it, you must clone the images directory
you'll find here : ``TP_TAROT > Projet > target > classes > images``
Without their images the application won't be displayed as will.
Replace them in the same directory onto your project

And you have to add the GSON library to your project.
